# AethysCore

AethysCore is a World of Warcraft addon to provide a simple and clean API to get most advanced WoW features.
It acts as a complete replacement of the WoW API and makes easy-to-use some non directly available informations in-game like the TimeToDie of an unit.

It is really simple to use and is used by [AethysRotation](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/AethysRotation) and [AethysTools](https://github.com/Aethys256/AethysTools).
You can also use anything from the addon in a WeakAura.
The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/AethysCore).
It is maintained by [Aethys](https://github.com/Aethys256/) and the [SimCMinMax](https://github.com/orgs/SimCMinMax/people) team.
Also, you can find it on [Curse](https://mods.curse.com/project/271528) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/projects/271528/).

## Advanced Users / Developper Notes
If you want to use the addon directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/AethysRotation), you would have to symlink every folders from this repository (AethysCore & AethysCache folders) to your WoW Addons folder.
