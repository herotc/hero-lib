HeroLib is a World of Warcraft addon to provide a simple and clean API to get most advanced WoW features.
It acts as a complete replacement of the WoW API and makes easy-to-use some non directly available informations in-game like the TimeToDie of an unit.

It is really simple to use and is used by [HeroRotation](https://github.com/herotc/hero-rotation) and [AethysTools](https://github.com/aethys256/AethysTools).
You can also use anything from the addon in a WeakAura.
The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/herotc/hero-lib).
It is maintained by [Aethys](https://github.com/aethys256/) and the [HeroTC](https://github.com/herotc) team.
Also, you can find it on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/herolib).

## Advanced Users / Developper Notes

If you want to use the addon directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/herotc/hero-lib), you would have to symlink every folders from this repository (HeroLib & HeroCache folders) to your WoW Addons folder.
